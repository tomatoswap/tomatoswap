The beginning of the way
Uniswap is currently the canonical development protocol and is an example. It is currently fundamental to all DeFi projects.
Our project is no exception. TomatoSwap fully relies on the innovative and reliable Uniswap protocol. Taking its design as a basis, we worked on special features that can complement the design of the protocol.
Protocol Design
Reward for liquidity improvers
Of course, our users may have a question about why the TomatoSwap project will be better than its progenitor.
The point is that liquidity providers are rewarded at Uniswap in the form of a commission for trading the pool only in case of an active increase in liquidity. Passive income stops going after their part of the pool is withdrawn. There is also a high probability of making a profit of an indefinite size, even despite the fact that a person is a key participant in the system, moreover, one of the first. Because stakeholders like venture funds, exchanges, mining pools join the protocol with huge capital.
Our advantage is a stable reward for increasing the pool liquidity in the TomatoSwap project in the form of our tokens TOMATO. This works even when you decide not to participate in the project anymore. Thus, you become a key link as one of the first users seeking to increase liquidity.
Your profitability will be proportional to the number of TomatoSwap project tokens you contributed. The decline in profitability will occur gradually, in conjunction with your decision not to participate in increasing liquidity.
Token Distribution
Of course, most of you are already Uniswap users. Realizing this, our Team made a decision to prepare a smooth and convenient distribution of tokens.
It’s easy to start making money with TomatoSwap! Just put the Uniswap LP tokens in the appropriate initial pool list.
One block provides the creation of 100 tokens of the TomatoSwap project, which are subsequently distributed among all participants in the pools. However, for the first two weeks, we are increasing the production of our tokens tenfold. Thus, each for each block will be issued 1000 tokens, which will further stimulate our investors to participate in the project.
Don’t forget to transfer your project tokens to Uniswap for additional bonuses! The decision to add new suitable pools remains with the project participants.
Distribution of tokens
In the TomatoSwap project, 0.3% goes directly to active liquidity providers. The remaining 0.65% is converted into our token TOMATO and then distributed among our investors.
Dev Fund
To increase the success of the project, our Team offers 10% of each token distribution to be allocated directly to developers.
Protocol
The TomatoSwap interface is identical to the Uniswap protocol interface. That is, if you have an identical protocol, it will be quite easy to integrate it into the TomatoSwap protocol. We are planning extensive cooperation with various DeFi projects.
Security Audits
Security is at the heart of our project. Reliability is important to us. And to ensure it, the TomatoSwap team has thoroughly tested the stability of the testnet.
Smart Contracts
We took some codes from other projects such as Uniswap / Yam / Compound. For example, a token contract with a voting function.
All contracts we write should have reasonable test coverage. We will continue to conduct additional testing. Let us know if you have any questions.
How You Can Participate
It’s very simple: deposit your LP tokens using the TomatoSwap interface!
